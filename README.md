# real-time-chat

  Create a basic chat application using raw websockets in Node.js with the following functionalities:
  
  Enable an administrator to initiate a new chat session/room, allowing them to configure properties such as Name, start_time, is_open, and cool_down_time.
    
  Enable users to join the room and send messages.
  
  Implement a feature for users to upvote chat messages.  
  
  If a chat message receives more than 3 upvotes, move it to a separate section.
  
  If a chat message accumulates more than 10 upvotes, trigger an alert for the administrator to respond.
